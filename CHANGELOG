(maybe a better FAQ)

next release
============

1.`sunrise/sunset`

If your weather provider doesn't deliver any sun relevant data, so fill 

	sr : '',
or
	sr : null,

(with an empty string or null).	

The sun relevant date will be vanished completely and leave an empty place in the PNG.

2.Http proxy
============

Please remember :

The 'process.env.HTTP_PROXY' is case sensitive.

Your proxy won't be found if the env variable was named 'http_proxy'.
